# Recipe Station

A ReactTS/Java app to store the recipes that I've found and made, along with any notes I want to keep about how it turned out.

User accounts that are not myself are planned in the future.

## Technologies

- React
- Typescript
- Vite
- TailwindCSS/PostCSS
- React-router-dom

## How to run

Site is available for viewing at (website goes here), but if you want to add anything or suggest changes, you can by doing this:

- Clone the repo with `git clone`

- Run `npm install` to install React/Vite packages on your local repo

- Then all you need is `npm run dev` to get a server running.
